See the full migration plan:
- `/portfolio/docs/development/job-finder-fe-migration-plan.md`
- `/portfolio/docs/development/job-finder-discovery-inventory.md`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist (Job Finder Page)
- [ ] Submit valid job URL
- [ ] Submit without auth (should show error)
- [ ] Submit duplicate job URL
- [ ] View real-time queue updates
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test responsive design

### E2E Tests (Future)
- [ ] Job submission flow
- [ ] Real-time queue updates
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Auth gating

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Bundle Size Warning** - Main chunk is 754kb (expected with Firebase + React)
   - Consider code splitting for optimization later
   - Not blocking for MVP

2. **Environment Variables** - Need to verify all endpoints work with:
   - Local Firebase emulators
   - Staging Cloud Functions
   - Production Cloud Functions

3. **Error Handling** - Could add:
   - Toast notifications for better UX
   - Error boundary for crash recovery
   - Retry UI for failed submissions
