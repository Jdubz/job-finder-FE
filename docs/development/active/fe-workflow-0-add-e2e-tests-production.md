Title: FE-WORKFLOW-0 — Add E2E Tests to Production Deployment (CRITICAL)
Labels: [priority-p0, repository-frontend, type-bugfix, status-todo, ci-cd]
Assignee: TBD
Priority: P0-Critical
Estimated Effort: 30 minutes
Repository: job-finder-FE
GitHub Issue: https://github.com/Jdubz/job-finder-FE/issues/29
```

## Summary

**CRITICAL PRODUCTION SAFETY ISSUE**: Add E2E tests to the production deployment workflow. Currently, staging runs E2E tests before deployment but production does NOT. This means broken UI can be deployed to production even though it would fail on staging, creating a critical risk of production outages.

## Background & Context

### Project Overview
**Application Name**: Job Finder Application  
**Technology Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Firebase Hosting, Playwright  
**Architecture**: Frontend application with automated CI/CD pipelines for staging and production deployments

### This Repository's Role
The job-finder-FE repository contains the React/TypeScript frontend application that provides the user interface for the Job Finder platform. It communicates with Firebase Cloud Functions for backend operations and uses Firebase Authentication for user management.

### Current State
The application currently:
- ✅ **Staging deployment**: Runs E2E tests before deployment via `deploy-staging.yml`
- ❌ **Production deployment**: Runs only linting, type checking, and unit tests via `deploy-production.yml`
- ❌ **No E2E safety net**: Production can receive broken UI that would fail on staging

### Desired State
After completion:
- Production deployment runs E2E tests before deploying
- Same safety guarantees as staging environment
- Broken UI cannot reach production users
- Consistent deployment quality across environments

## Technical Specifications

### Affected Files
```yaml
MODIFY:
- .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml - Add E2E test job as dependency
- .github/workflows/README.md - Update workflow documentation

CREATE:
- scripts/e2e/smoke-tests.sh - Production smoke test script
```

### Technology Requirements
**Languages**: YAML, Shell Script  
**Frameworks**: GitHub Actions, Playwright  
**Tools**: Firebase CLI, Node.js 18+  
**Dependencies**: Existing Playwright configuration in job-finder-FE

### Code Standards
**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing workflow naming patterns  
**File Organization**: Place scripts in `scripts/e2e/` directory  
**Import Style**: Use existing shell script patterns

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Analyze Current Production Workflow**
   - Review `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` structure
   - Identify where to insert E2E test job
   - Document current deployment time (baseline)

2. **Add E2E Test Job to Production Workflow**
   - Copy E2E test job from `deploy-staging.yml`
   - Modify for production environment variables
   - Add as dependency for deployment job
   - Ensure proper environment setup

3. **Create Production Smoke Test Script**
   - Create `scripts/e2e/smoke-tests.sh`
   - Include critical user flows: login, job submission, queue status
   - Add environment-specific configuration
   - Include proper error handling and cleanup

4. **Update Workflow Documentation**
   - Update `.github/workflows/README.md`
   - Document the new E2E requirement
   - Add troubleshooting for E2E test failures

### Architecture Decisions

**Why this approach:**
- Reuse existing E2E test infrastructure from staging
- Minimal code duplication by copying proven patterns
- Consistent testing approach across environments

**Alternatives considered:**
- Custom E2E tests for production: More work, potential for divergence
- Skip E2E for production: Unacceptable safety risk

### Dependencies & Integration

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Depends on: Existing Playwright E2E test suite in job-finder-FE
- Consumed by: Production deployment workflow

**External Dependencies:**
- APIs: None (tests run against deployed frontend)
- Services: Firebase Hosting, GitHub Actions

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Required

**Integration Tests:**
- Production deployment workflow runs E2E tests successfully
- E2E tests pass against production-like environment
- Deployment fails if E2E tests fail

**Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Production workflow runs E2E tests before deployment
- [ ] E2E test failure prevents production deployment
- [ ] E2E tests pass in production environment
- [ ] Deployment time increase is acceptable (<2 minutes)

### Test Data

**Sample test scenarios:**
- User login flow
- Job submission form
- Queue status polling
- Error handling for network failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production deployment workflow includes E2E test job as dependency
- [ ] E2E tests run successfully in production environment
- [ ] Production deployment fails if E2E tests fail
- [ ] E2E test execution adds <2 minutes to deployment time
- [ ] All existing staging E2E tests work in production context
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect E2E requirement for production

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools and versions
Node.js: v18+
npm: v9+
Firebase CLI: latest
GitHub Actions: configured
```

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone frontend repository
git clone https://github.com/Jdubz/job-finder-FE.git
cd job-finder-FE

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Environment variables needed
cp .env.example .env.production
# Configure production Firebase project settings
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Run E2E tests locally (for validation)
npm run e2e

# Test production workflow locally
npm run build
firebase serve --only hosting
```

## Code Examples & Patterns

### Example Implementation

**Current production workflow (problematic):**
```yaml
jobs:
  quality-checks:
    # ... existing checks
  deploy:
    needs: quality-checks
    # Deploys without E2E verification
```

**Fixed production workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  quality-checks:
    # ... existing checks
  e2e-tests:
    needs: quality-checks
    # Run E2E tests against staging-like environment
  deploy:
    needs: [quality-checks, e2e-tests]
    # Only deploy if E2E tests pass
```

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in E2E test failures
- [ ] Tests don't interact with real user data
- [ ] Proper cleanup of test artifacts

### Performance
- [ ] E2E test execution time: <3 minutes
- [ ] Parallel test execution where possible
- [ ] Efficient browser cleanup between tests

### Error Handling
```bash
# Example error handling in workflow
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    npm run e2e || {
      echo "E2E tests failed - blocking production deployment"
      exit 1
    }
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Add comments to workflow explaining E2E requirement
- [ ] Document test failure scenarios and resolution

### README Updates
Update repository README.md with:
- [ ] Production deployment now includes E2E tests
- [ ] E2E test failure blocks production deployment
- [ ] How to troubleshoot E2E test failures

## Commit Message Requirements
