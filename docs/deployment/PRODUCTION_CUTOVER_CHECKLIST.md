# Check Cloud Functions

for func in manageJobQueue manageGenerator manageExperience manageContentItems contact-form; do
echo -n "$func: "
     curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://us-central1-static-sites-257923.cloudfunctions.net/$func"
done

````

## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

Execute rollback immediately if:

- ‚ùå Site returns 404 or 500 errors
- ‚ùå Authentication completely broken
- ‚ùå Critical user flow completely broken
- ‚ùå Data corruption detected
- ‚ùå Security vulnerability discovered

### Rollback Procedure

**Time to Execute**: 2-3 minutes

```bash
# 1. IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
firebase hosting:rollback --site job-finder-production

# 2. Verify rollback
curl -I https://job-finder.joshwentworth.com  # Cloudflare proxy (origin: https://job-finder-production.web.app)

# 3. Notify team
echo "Production rolled back at $(date)" >> deployment.log

# 4. Create incident issue
# Go to GitHub and create issue with details

# 5. Schedule post-mortem
# Coordinate with PM for root cause analysis
```

### Post-Rollback Actions

- [ ] Document what went wrong
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for the problem
- [ ] Fix issue in staging first
- [ ] Re-verify in staging thoroughly
- [ ] Schedule new deployment attempt

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

| Risk                     | Mitigation              | Rollback Time     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Authentication failure   | Pre-test in staging     | 2 minutes         |
| API endpoint errors      | Verify staging CF first | 2 minutes         |
| Build/deployment failure | Automated tests         | 2 minutes         |
| Performance degradation  | Load test staging       | 5 minutes         |
