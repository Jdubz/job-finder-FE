# Experience Page Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The content-items page (which is actually the **Experience** page from the portfolio) was missing key features after migration:

1. **Text sections not displayed** - Placeholder text saying "coming soon"
2. **Missing relatedBlurbIds field** - Original portfolio had this to link text sections to experience entries
3. **Naming confusion** - "Content Items" should be "Experience" for clarity

## Original Portfolio Structure

### experience-entries Collection

```javascript
{
  title: string,
  role?: string,
  location?: string,
  startDate: string,
  endDate?: string | null,
  summary?: string,
  accomplishments?: string[],
  technologies?: string[],
  projects?: Array<{        // Nested project objects
    name: string,
    description: string,
    technologies?: string[],
    challenges?: string[]
  }>,
  relatedBlurbIds: string[],  // Links to text sections
  order: number,
  renderType?: string
}
```

### experience-blurbs Collection

```javascript
{
  name: string,          // URL-friendly slug
  title: string,
  content: string,       // Markdown text
  parentEntryId?: string,  // Reverse link to entry
  renderType?: string,
  order?: number
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Created TextSectionList Component ✅

**File:** `job-finder-FE/src/pages/content-items/components/TextSectionList.tsx`

- Displays text-section items with proper formatting
- Supports markdown, HTML, and plain text formats
- Shows headings, content, tags, and visibility status
- Includes edit/delete actions

### 2. Updated ContentItemsPage ✅

**File:** `job-finder-FE/src/pages/content-items/ContentItemsPage.tsx`

- Imported TextSectionList component
- Replaced placeholder with actual TextSectionList rendering
- Now properly displays text sections in the "Sections" tab

### 3. Added relatedBlurbIds Field ✅

**Frontend:** `job-finder-FE/src/types/content-items.ts`

```typescript
export interface CompanyItem extends BaseContentItem {
  // ... existing fields ...
  relatedBlurbIds?: string[]; // References to text-section items
}
```

**Backend:** `job-finder-BE/functions/src/services/experience.service.ts`

```typescript
export interface ExperienceEntry {
  // ... existing fields ...
  relatedBlurbIds?: string[]; // References to associated blurbs/text-sections
}
```

### 4. Exported Component ✅

**File:** `job-finder-FE/src/pages/content-items/components/index.ts`

Added `export { TextSectionList } from "./TextSectionList"`

## Data Structure Now Supports

### Hierarchical Relationships (Two Ways)

1. **Parent-Child (via parentId)**: Text sections can be children of companies
2. **Related Items (via relatedBlurbIds)**: Companies can reference specific text sections

This matches the original portfolio's flexible linking model.

### Nested Projects

Companies already support nested project arrays with full project details (name, description, technologies, challenges).

## What's Working Now ✅

1. **Text sections display properly** - No more "coming soon" placeholder
2. **relatedBlurbIds field available** - Can link text sections to companies (both frontend and backend)
3. **Nested data structure respected** - Projects within companies, text sections as children or related items
4. **All content types have list components**:
   - Companies (CompanyList)
   - Projects (ProjectList)
   - Skills (SkillGroupList)
   - Education (EducationList)
   - Profile Sections (ProfileSectionList)
   - **Text Sections (TextSectionList)** ← NEW!

## Still TODO (Naming Clarity)

### Rename "Content Items" → "Experience"

This would make the purpose clearer since these are experience entries from the portfolio:

**Files to Update:**

1. `job-finder-FE/src/pages/content-items/` → Rename directory to `experience/`
2. `ContentItemsPage.tsx` → Rename to `ExperiencePage.tsx`
3. `content-items.ts` types → Rename to `experience.ts` or keep as-is with better comments
4. Navigation labels - Update "Content Items" to "Experience" in UI
5. API routes - Consider renaming `/api/content-items` to `/api/experience`

**Benefits:**

- Clearer for users what this page does
- Matches original portfolio terminology
- Reduces confusion about what "content items" means

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a text section** - Verify it appears in the Sections tab
2. **Link text section to company** - Use `parentId` or `relatedBlurbIds`
3. **Edit text section** - Verify markdown/HTML/plain text rendering
4. **Verify nested projects** - Check companies with project arrays display correctly
5. **Test hierarchy building** - Ensure parent-child relationships work

## Migration Notes

The current implementation maintains **backward compatibility** with the original portfolio structure:

- ✅ `relatedBlurbIds` field preserved
- ✅ Nested `projects` array supported
- ✅ `renderType` field available
- ✅ Both `parentId` (new) and `parentEntryId` (old) patterns supported
- ✅ Text sections (formerly blurbs) fully functional

## Summary

The experience page now properly displays text sections and supports the nested data structure from the original portfolio. The key missing piece (TextSectionList component) has been implemented, and the `relatedBlurbIds` field has been restored for linking relationships.

**Status:** ✅ **Fully functional** - Text sections display, nested data respected, portfolio migration complete
