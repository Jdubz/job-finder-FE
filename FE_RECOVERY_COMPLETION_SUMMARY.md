## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Systematic Approach**: Breaking tasks into clear phases helped execution
2. **Documentation First**: Creating docs during implementation ensured nothing was missed
3. **Verification Built In**: Automated checks caught issues early
4. **Rollback Planning**: Having rollback procedures ready provides confidence

### Improvements for Next Time
1. **E2E Tests**: Should have been implemented earlier
2. **GitHub Environments**: Could have been set up in parallel
3. **Worker B Coordination**: Earlier coordination would have helped
4. **Service Account**: Pre-generating would have saved time

### Best Practices Established
1. Always verify deployment with HTTP checks
2. Always test Cloud Functions connectivity
3. Always create comprehensive rollback procedures
4. Always document while implementing, not after
