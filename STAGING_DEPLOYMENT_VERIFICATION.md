- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Configured
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Configured
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Configured

### API Endpoints (Cloud Functions - Staging)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: https://us-central1-static-sites-257923.cloudfunctions.net
- `VITE_GENERATOR_API_URL`: manageGenerator-staging
- `VITE_EXPERIENCE_API_URL`: manageExperience-staging
- `VITE_CONTENT_ITEMS_API_URL`: manageContentItems-staging

## Security Headers Verified

The following security headers are configured in `firebase.json`:

✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY  
✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  
✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block  
✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin  
✅ Strict-Transport-Security: HSTS enabled  
✅ Content-Security-Policy: Configured with allowed sources  
✅ X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow (staging only)  

---

## Cloud Functions Integration Status

### Expected Staging Endpoints
The frontend is configured to call the following staging Cloud Functions:

1. **Document Generator**: `manageGenerator-staging`
2. **Experience Management**: `manageExperience-staging`
3. **Content Items**: `manageContentItems-staging`
4. **Job Queue**: `manageJobQueue-staging`
5. **Contact Form**: `contact-form-staging`

### Next Steps for Integration Verification
- [ ] Verify all Cloud Functions are deployed with `-staging` suffix
- [ ] Test authentication flow with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Test API connectivity from frontend to Cloud Functions
- [ ] Run E2E smoke tests against staging environment
- [ ] Coordinate with Worker B for UI smoke tests

---

## Build Performance

### Bundle Analysis
- Main bundle: 773.11 kB (209.75 kB gzipped)
- CSS bundle: 41.47 kB (8.04 kB gzipped)
- Total files: 48 static assets
- Build time: 4.13 seconds

### Optimization Notes
⚠️ Some chunks exceed 500 kB - consider code splitting for future optimization:
- Potential improvements:
  - Dynamic import() for route-based code splitting
  - Manual chunks configuration for vendor libraries
  - Tree-shaking optimization review
